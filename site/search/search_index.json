It is an archival storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Glacier is optimized for data that you do not need to retrieve frequently, but still want to keep for extended periods of time.</p> <p>Here are some key characteristics and use cases for Amazon Glacier:</p> <ol> <li>Archival Storage:</li> <li> <p>Glacier is designed for storing data that you want to retain for a long time, often for compliance, regulatory, or backup purposes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Low Cost:</p> </li> <li> <p>Glacier offers lower storage costs compared to other Amazon S3 storage classes. However, retrieving data from Glacier may incur additional costs and have longer retrieval times.</p> </li> <li> <p>Durability and Reliability:</p> </li> <li> <p>Glacier is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability of objects over a given year, meaning it is highly reliable for long-term storage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Retention Policies:</p> </li> <li> <p>Glacier allows you to define data retention policies to ensure that your data is stored for the desired duration.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Archiving and Compliance:</p> </li> <li> <p>It is commonly used for archiving data that must be retained for regulatory compliance, legal requirements, or business records.</p> </li> <li> <p>Backup and Disaster Recovery:</p> </li> <li> <p>Glacier can be used as a cost-effective solution for long-term backup and disaster recovery, especially for data that does not need to be accessed frequently.</p> </li> <li> <p>Media and Entertainment:</p> </li> <li> <p>Glacier is used in the media and entertainment industry to store large volumes of media assets, such as images, videos, and audio files.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scientific Research:</p> </li> <li> <p>Scientists and researchers often use Glacier to archive research data, as it provides a reliable and low-cost solution for preserving large datasets.</p> </li> <li> <p>Digital Preservation:</p> </li> <li>Libraries, archives, and museums use Glacier to preserve digital collections and historical records.</li> </ol> <p>It's important to note that retrieving data from Glacier can take several hours, so it's best suited for data that does not require immediate access. If you need more frequent access to your data, you may want to consider other AWS storage services like Amazon S3 or Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive, which offer faster retrieval times at a higher cost.</p>"},{"location":"Cloud%20Computing/AWS/Amazon%20RDS/","title":"Amazon RDS","text":"<p>RDS  : Relational Database Service A\u00a0DB engine\u00a0is the specific relational database software that runs on your DB instance.
